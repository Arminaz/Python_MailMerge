# Mail Merge Application

This repository contains a simple Python program designed for generating personalized letters based on a template. The program takes names from a list stored in the `Input/Names/` directory and substitutes them into placeholder within the starting letter located in the `Letters` directory in `Input`. The resulting personalized letters are saved in an `Output/ReadyToSend` directory for convenience.
